# 🛡️ Signature-Based Virus Detection Model

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **signature-based detection model** for identifying **computer viruses and malware**. The model is designed to recognize known malicious signatures within files, leveraging **machine learning and deep learning** techniques.

Signature-based detection is a widely used approach in **antivirus software** and **malware analysis**. It works by comparing file contents with a database of known malware signatures to identify potential threats.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 **Signature-Based Virus Detection**: Identifies malware by matching file signatures with known malicious patterns.
- 🧠 **Deep Learning Integration**: Uses **TensorFlow** and **neural networks** for learning and classifying signatures.
- 📊 **Visualization Tools**: Implements **confusion matrices** and **data visualization** for analysis.
- ⚡ **Efficient Data Preprocessing**: Uses **normalization techniques** to improve detection performance.

## 📝 How It Works
1️⃣ **Load the dataset**: Signature-based malware dataset (if applicable).  
2️⃣ **Preprocess the data**: Normalize and format signatures for detection.  
3️⃣ **Train a deep learning model**: Uses **TensorFlow & Keras** to classify files as **malicious or safe**.  
4️⃣ **Evaluate the model**: Uses confusion matrix and accuracy metrics.  
5️⃣ **Predict new files**: The trained model detects malware in real-world files.
